        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>Welcome to coffeetrainer.cafe! I am happy that you decided to check out my passion project, and I hope you have a positive experience with my program.
            When creating this project I set out to create a tool that helps new baristas get a better understanding of the POS that they work in and
            to have an easier time grasping the layout without being rushed onto the floor with the risk of ringing up a wrong order. Every time I thought
            project was finished, I found a new way to improve it. At this time the random customer generator that the program uses can utilize all customization options,
            and creates the possibility of over 8.12 × 10<sup>22</sup> possible "customer" requests. If this project was utilized by the company, it would save 
            approximately $720,000 dollars a year(this is a rough estimate). If you are interested in using this project in your store, please send me an email at jacobharper259@gmail.com.
        </p>

            <div>
                <p>The Drink Visualizer is an intuitive way to show drinks with their
                    core ingredients. By interpreting the information sent by the coffeetrainerAPI,
                    the visualizer can generate a picture that shows exactly what percentage
                    of the drink is sugary syrup and what part is coffee. This will help 
                    both baristas and customers get a better understanding of what is going to
                    cups.
                </p>
                <p>When making these drinks, don't forget to add the love and care by hand from the heart!</p>

            <h2><a class="menu" href="http://localhost:8000/pos">POS Simulator</a></h2>
            <div class="renderimages"><img src="../IMG/menu.png"></div>
            <div><p>Using the app, baristas can effectively: learn how to take actual customer
                orders, become familiar with the layout of the POS system, and become more comfortable asking questions to customers
                so they can make the moment right with every order. This project takes in many parameters to wholly simulate
                on-the-job scenarios, so partners feel comfortable before their first day on the floor.
